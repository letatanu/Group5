# ClassProject: **Design**

### Product Overview
* Purpose and Scope
	_You should describe this document by giving its purpose, scope._
* Target Audience
	_Describe the target audience for this document._
* Terms and Definitions
	_Define any terms or acronyms you will be using in the remainder of this document._

### Design Considerations
* Constraints and Dependencies
	_What constrains, either functional or non-functional were you required to adhere to in designing and implementing your system?_
* Methodology
	_Describe the software engineering methodology or methodologies you will use, justify your choice(s), and briefly discuss how you implemented them._

### System Overview
	_A complete, high level system description goes here.  This section should provide a high level abstraction of the entire project, and prepare the reader for the system architecture discussion.  You should provide supporting diagrams and tables where appropriate._

### System Architecture
* Subsystem, Component or Object 1
	_Provide a detailed, high level description of the first subsystem, component or object of your system.  Your choice of terms should reflect the development methodology you chose in the design considerations section._ 
	_You should provide a detailed description of the interface. A high level description of the internal architecture is also appropriate here.  You may want to outline any important algorithms as well._
	_Be sure to include supporting diagrams, such as UML diagrams, interaction diagrams and data flow diagrams, wherever appropriate._
* Sub-subsystem, sub-component or sub-object 1-1
	_Some of the larger subsystems, components or objects may need to be broken down further to complete the high-level picture. The same guidelines for content apply in this section as in its parent section._

### Detailed System Design
* Subsystem, Component or Object 1
	_Here, you will provide a highly detailed description of your subsystem, component or object.  You will describe your implementation in a fair amount of detail.  It is quite common to see pseudo code or even source listed in this section for portions of the object.  List the data structures you will use, helper functions that you will need, and any other facet of the implementation that helps the reader understand your implementation.  It is unlikely that you will need to introduce any new diagrams in this section._
* Sub-subsystem, sub-component or sub-object 1-1
